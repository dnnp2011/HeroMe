# HeroMe
A fun make-your-own-hero project for Android 8.1 (Oreo)

## Description

Hero Me is a native Android application which can basically be described as a user interface demo. The feature set consists solely or clicking through a few screens. However, the real benefit of working on this app was learning to create and organize various interfaces, interacting with user touch input to navigate between activities and fragments, using custom color gradients to match a theme palette, and other foundational skills.w

## Note

Does not use the Android compatibility Fragment, and is therefore not compatible with very old version of Android.
